<img src="profilepic.jpg"/>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> With a strong foundation in business and a passion for driving growth and success, I’m a driven and dynamic professional. After completing my MBA, I joined a B2B e-commerce startup, where I honed my skills as a business developer for one year and then seamlessly transitioned into the role of a category manager for another year. Along with that I also have one year of experience working in an IT industry in my early career days as an Associate software engineer.<br><br>

    Throughout my time in these roles, I was put across various functionalities and was given an opportunity to get my hands dirty, allowing me to identify new business opportunities, build strong relationships with key stakeholders, handle sales team and drive results through data-driven decision making. My communication skills and ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams have contributed to my success in driving growth for my employer.<br><br>
    
    With keen interest in technical products and how they make life easy, I have done a professional Product Management course at Northwestern Kellogg’s. With a thirst for new challenges, I’m now seeking to transition into entry level product roles. I’m confident that my strong background in engineering & business, coupled with my passion for technology and innovation, will enable me to excel in this new challenge and be a value addition to my future employer.
